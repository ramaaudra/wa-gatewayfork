2.  **Login**: Existing users can log in with their username and password.
3.  **Data Isolation**: Once logged in, all data including WhatsApp sessions, media files, auto-reply configurations, and message history will be isolated to your user account. You will only be able to see and manage your own data.

## API Documentation & Authentication

The original API documentation can be found here: <a target="_blank" href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/16528402/VVXC3EjU">POSTMAN</a>.

**Important API Authentication Update:**

With the introduction of user authentication, **all API routes are now protected and require authentication.**

-   **Authentication Method**: API authentication is handled via session cookies. To use the API, you must first log in through the web dashboard. Your API client (e.g., Postman, curl, custom scripts) must then include the session cookie (usually named `connect.sid`) in its requests to the API endpoints.
-   **How to obtain the session cookie**:
    1.  Log in to the dashboard via a web browser.
    2.  Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the cookies sent with requests to the backend (e.g., when navigating dashboard pages or making API calls from the dashboard's "Send Message" page).
    3.  Copy the value of the `connect.sid` cookie (or the equivalent session cookie name if it differs).
    4.  Include this cookie in the `Cookie` header of your API requests. For example: `Cookie: connect.sid=your_session_cookie_value_here`
-   **Unauthorized Access**: If you attempt to access a protected API route without a valid session cookie, the API will respond with a `401 Unauthorized` error and a JSON message indicating that authentication is required.

Future versions might include token-based authentication for more convenient API usage, but currently, session-based authentication is used.
